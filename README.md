# Pattern Printing

  - Any thing that is printed in console starts from top left and flows to bottom right is a <B> Pattern </B>.
  - It will fill top row first until a new line is encountered or row is completely filled, 
  then it will proceed with next row and continue in that fashion.
  - Any thing to be printed has to be printed using combination of a designated character (say ‘*’), space and new line.
  Then there has to be at least two loops like <B> For Loops, While Loops </B>.
  - There has to be one outer loop which will completely span through one row of screen, 
  and there have to be at least one one or multiple inner loops which will print character or space as per our 
  requirement in increasing or decreasing progression or constant some times.

  ## Languages used 
  ### Python
  - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
  - Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  - Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
  - It is similar to English as the complications of writing the code is very less compared to other languages.
  - A 4 line printing code in Java can be done in 1 line in Python.
  - It can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.
